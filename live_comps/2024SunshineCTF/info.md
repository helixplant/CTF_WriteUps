# 2024 Sunshine CTF
**Date:** October 19-21, 2024 <br>
Participated with University Team

**Overall Thoughts:** <br>
I went into this CTF knowing that I only had so many hours to dedicate to it as I had 25+ hours of work on the days it was active, not including class work and exams I had to complete. This means I was unable to participate in as much challenges as I wish I could. However, I do plan on solving as many questions as possible post competition, meaning there should be more updates soon. 

I was able to complete two forensics challenges, which were fun. Both were essentially the same challenge, just with slight variance. 

I am happy I was able to participate. Though I hope the next CTF I participate in will be during a time that I do not have any other distractions.
