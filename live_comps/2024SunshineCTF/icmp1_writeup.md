### SunshineCTF 2024 -- live competition
` forensics `
# 
### Summary
First forensics challenge to search for a flag hidden in various packets.

### Setting and Software
This CTF was completed utilzing Wireshark

### Given Media
- Wireshark packet capture ` icmp1.pcapng `

## Execution

### Download Files
Download the given Wireshark file and open in the Wireshark software. You will see 3136 packets that must be searched through to find the flag.


### Search for Flag
Given the wording of the challenge itself, we can assume that the flag can be found in a *ping* packet, or an ICMP protocol. This is a simple search where we must apply a Display Filter to find the ICMP protocol packets. Placing ***ICMP*** in the Display Filter search box produced exactly 24 packets that fall under this protocol, which is much more reasonable to search through. <br>

Manually searching through the files reveals the flag. Packet No. 3135 first reveals the flag.

## Result

### Flag
` sun{0n1y_a_p1ng_@way} `

### Thoughts
I completed this second. It wasn't too complex like the previous one. It was fun to search through the packets.
