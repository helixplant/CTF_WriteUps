### SunshineCTF 2024 -- live competition
` forensics `
# 
### Summary
Second forensics challenge to search for a flag hidden in various packets.

### Setting and Software
This CTF was completed utilzing Wireshark

### Given Media
- Wireshark packet capture ` icmp2.pcapng `

## Execution

### Download Files
Download the given Wireshark file and open in the Wireshark software. You will see 5997 packets that must be searched through to find the flag.


### Search for Flag
Given the wording of the challenge itself and the previous ICMP1 challenge, we can assume that the flag can be found in a *ping* packet, or an ICMP protocol. This is a simple search where we must apply a Display Filter to find the ICMP protocol packets. Placing ***ICMP*** in the Display Filter search box produced exactly 10 packets that fall under this protocol, which is much more reasonable to search through. <br>



Looking through the first packet displayed, No. 5449, we see a message stating the flag has been dispersed throughout the ping packets.

The flag is scattered through the following text:

From packet 5976<br>

## Result

### Flag
` sun{1cmp_1s_4un_1337} `

### Thoughts
This was a fun step into the competition. I personally love going through packets so I had a great deal of fun searching!
