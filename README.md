# CTF_WriteUps

Welcome to my CTF write up folder, this will contain my process in solving CTFs either from live competitions or from completed competitions and practice rooms. 


This is to be split into two categories <a href="#live">live CTFs</a> and <a href="#practice">practice/completed CTFs</a>

<section id="live">Live CTF Write Ups</section>


<section id="practice">Practice and Completed CTF Write Ups</section>
